		When I left my flying job, I delved into getting fit, searching for fun fitness classes, jogging in the park and practicing yoga on the balcony (see my pre-pregnancy featured photo!). Since becoming pregant, however, I have become pretty lazy, especially whilst suffering from morning sickness all day. No more yoga bod! When I could no longer fit into my favourite winter coat due to my growing bum (not bump!) I decided to find a fitness class I could love enough to stick to! Here is a round up of my favourite classes so far.</p>

		<h2>Frame</h2>
		<p>I first discovered <a href="https://www.moveyourframe.com/timetable">Frame</a> when I first moved to London in Shoreditch. I fell in love with their exhuberent instructors and quirky classes, such as 80's Rave and Jane Fonda Aerobics. I'm pleased to say that they have opened a new studio just round the corner from me in Kings Cross! Whilst not as big as the Shoreditch venue, Frame Kings Cross still offer great classes such as ballet based Frame Barre (my absolute fave class which gets results) and reformer pilates.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately now that I am pregnant the instructors have advised me that I should just stick to their recommended classes: Get Leggy and Frame Bumps. I love Get Leggy-the Monday morning class at 930am is so quiet-in the last class I went to I was the only one there! Susie the instructor worked me incredibly hard using ballet based moves on my legs as well as some kickboxing and kettlebell exercises. The day after my first class I hurt all over meaning I actually worked hard for once! I cannot wait for my next Get Leggy workout. Take a look at my Frame review <a href="https://yumballs.wordpress.com/2015/11/06/getting-sweaty-at-a-prenatal-class-frame-style/">blogpost</a></p>
